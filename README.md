# social-network-backend


## Description
I was motivated to design a backend to a social networking application that allows users to be created, users to create thoughts(posts), allows other users to react to thoughts, and have users add friends. I built this project in order to replicate a backend similar to many other social networking sites and implement a body of code that could be used with front end design to create a fully functioning social networking site.
