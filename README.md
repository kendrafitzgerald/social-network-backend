# social-network-backend


## Description
I was motivated to design a backend to a social networking application that allows users to be created, users to create thoughts(posts), allows other users to react to thoughts, and have users add friends. I built this project in order to replicate a backend similar to many other social networking sites and implement a body of code that could be used with front end design to create a fully functioning social networking site. This project solves the problem of creating a typical backend to a social network app where users can be added, users can post 'thoughts' or reactions to other users 'thoughts', and users can become friends with other users. This project successfully creates API routes that allow all the above functionality to be implemented. The technologies used in this project were Express.Js, Node.js, and MongoDB for database implementation. I learned how to successfully utilize the MongoDB database to create this project. 

## Installation

To install this project, clone the repo into your local machine. Once cloned, run ```npm install``` in your terminal to install all of the dependencies necessary for the project to run. Finally, run ```node server.js``` in your terminal to run your server. Navigate to an application, such as Insomnia, that allows you to view API routes in order to see the routes in action!

## Usage
Open the server.js file in your terminal run ```node server.js```. Then, navigate to your API routing environment such as Insomnia. Begin testing the various routes in your environment utilizing the URL http://localhost:3001/api/. Make sure to input the correct URL params after the ```api/``` portion of the URL depending on the route you are trying to test. To see this in action, please view the walkthrough video linked here.
